### Determine whether more goals are scored in women's international soccer matches than men's?

### Problem description:
The question at stake is:
Are more goals scored in women's international soccer matches than men's?
Assume a 10% significance level, and use the following null and alternative hypotheses:
H0: The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's.
HA: The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is greater than men's.


### Data 
The data was provided in Datacamp and was added to this repository


### Motivation
I wanted to practice the different stages of hypothesis testing


### Thought process
- I conducted exploratory analysis
- I subseted both dataframes in accordance with the project's criteria
- I examined and visualised the values distribution to the determine the type of test statistic
- I utilised the MWU test statistic
